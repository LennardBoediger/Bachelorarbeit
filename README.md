### This is my Bachelorthesis: "Entwicklung und Realisierung eines Messsystems mit den Sensoren AS7261 und AS72651 von AMS"

The goal of this work is to develop a spectral sensor platform using the AS7261 and AS72651, which can be used modularly for different 
research purposes, but especially for daylight measurement. Since it is not possible to measure in several directions in the sky at the same 
time with only one of the AS7261 (or AS72651) sensors without mechanical components, it must be ensured that a large number of sensors can be 
combined into a sensor array in order to be able to measure directional resolution. The resulting sensor platform uses a Raspberry Pi 4 as central 
control unit, which communicates with external sensor boards via I2C.

The final sensor platform will be able to differentiate 21 spectral channels of incident light from up to 20 different directions.
